# Three.js Solar Scene

This project is a 3D solar scene built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It features a rotating Earth-like sphere, an orbiting moon, a textured plane, and a starry background. Shadows and lighting effects are included to enhance realism.

**NOTE!**: This project was written entirely using Copilot Edits! There are stupid project structure decisions that I've left intact since it mirrors how it was generated by the tool.

## Features

- **Earth-like Sphere**: A textured sphere that rotates and gently moves up and down in a sine wave motion.
- **Moon**: A smaller textured sphere that orbits the Earth-like sphere and rotates in the opposite direction.
- **Textured Plane**: A plane beneath the spheres with a water-like texture.
- **Stars**: A dynamic starry background with twinkling effects.
- **Lighting and Shadows**: Directional lighting simulates sunlight, with shadows cast by the spheres.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```

## Usage

1. Start a local server to serve the project files (e.g., using `http-server` or a similar tool).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enjoy the interactive 3D scene!

## File Structure

- **`main.js`**: Contains the Three.js code for rendering the scene.
- **`textures/`**: Directory for texture files (e.g., Earth, Moon, water, and stars).

## Requirements
